Concept
Web/mobile application that allows users to look for a list of possible recipes based on the ingredients they have on their fridge. I.e instead of the user search the internet for "how to make a <meal>", the user will provide a list of all ingredients he has (cheese, pasta, miced meat, tomatoes, lemon, carrots) and application will return a possible meal that can be done with them. 
In this case system would return a pasta-bolognese, if leaving lemon and carrots out. A toggle option can be added to match all ingredients or "the best match".
